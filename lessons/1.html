                    <h2>Tools:Browser-based development</h2>
                    <p>There are three major web browser platforms to consider:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the platform that Firefox runs on</li>
                            <li>Mozilla Foundation's web platform created by web developers</li>
                            <li>Gecko rendering engine: fast and progressive</li>
                            <li>Excellent level of standards compliance</li>
                            <li>Corporate independence</li>
                            <li>No built-in development tools</li>
                            <li>Plethora of add-ons that make web development easy</li>
                            <li>Add-ons have a downside: bloat</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><a href="https://webkit.org/">WebKit</a></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the platform that gives us Chrome, Safari and Opera, with a few other smaller browsers out there as well.</li>
                            <li>Excellent platform that is very fast and standards compliant</li>
                            <li>Third parties can download the source, make local adjustments and release their own version, as Google and Apple have both done</li>
                            <li>Standalone version can be downloaded at any time for the latest release</li>
                            <li>Development is done via the built-in Developer Tools</li>
                            <li>Initially a thin environment, recent releases have made Webkit-based browsers excellent for developers</li>
                            <li>Macintosh based developers may need to <a href="http://www.jonhartmann.com/index.cfm/2011/4/28/Enabling-Safari-Developer-Tools">enable web developer options</a> in Safari before accessing the developer tools</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/">Microsoft</a></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The vendor for Edge and Internet Explorer</li>
                            <li>Microsoft's Edge is a major improvement on it's previous browser offerings.</li>
                            <li>Edge offers very good standards compliance and browser tools.</li>
                            <li>Do <b>NOT</b> use Internet Explorer as your development browser. It is one the least standards compliant of the browsers. It is also no longer supported with updates.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Remember to test your work in as many browsers as you can! <a href="http://browsershots.org/">BrowserShots</a> allows you to do basic testing for earlier versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera. If you need to test for early iterations of IE, try: <a href="http://netrenderer.com">Netrenderer</a></p>

                        The Web Developer Toolbar is available for Chrome, Firefox and Opera. Some useful features include:

                    <h2>Browser Based Diagnostic Tools</h2>
                    <p>As web pages get more complex, it can become difficult figuring out what is going on. For example, CSS rules that override other CSS rules, if spread across several files, can be challenge to make sense of. Having a diagnostic tool to assist in developing will make it easier to examine every detail of web pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most modern browsers have some kind of development environment that can be turned on or triggered via extensions and/or plug-ins.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>File and folder names should NOT contain:</li>

                        <li>Acceptable non-alphanumeric characters: . _ - ~</li>
                        <li>Filenames should either be descriptive of the file contents, or use the default page name: index.htm, index.html or index.shtml (or whatever your server default is)</li>
                        <li>•Folder names should always be descriptive. Folder structure should be logical (eg: /hockey/nhl/canucks).</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Including an <b>index.html</b> file in every folder on your server will ensure users cannot go snooping around your filesystem. the index.html file can be a blank HTML page if you like, as long as the user does not see a list of files when they request a folder</li>
                        <li>Browser caching can reduce excessive request/response transactions between client and server. however, some browsers may cache things like the CSS, so if the styles have changed since caching the client may not get the latest styles.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ctrl + F5 (Cmd + F5 for Mac) will force a page reload. Very useful when developing on a localhost http server.</li>
                            <li>If a file name has changed, the browser will have to make a new request from the server. versioning your file names will ensure users always have the latest version of any file (for example styles_1.0.css, styles_1.1.css, styles_1.2.css, styles_2.0.css etc)</li>
