                    <p>If it is not specified, a web browser will choose the character set it thinks is most appropriate, but it is a better practice for the developer to ensure the correct character set by applying the <b>meta</b> tag to the <b>head</b> section of every HTML page:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Write all your text-based code (.html, .css, .js, .php, etc) in UTF-8. At development time, ensure your text editor is saving files in this format. This setting is usually found in the application's Preferences menu option.</li>
                        <li>Unless your audience includes very old browsers, you can <a href="https://tools.oratory.com/altcodes.html">code special characters</a> directly into the HTML (you dont need to use HTML entities for most special characters).</li>
                        <li>You cannot copy-paste rich text (such as Microsoft Word, or WordPad) into your HTML. The rich text formatting may result in an unreadable mess</li>
                        <li>An HTTP server can over-ride your charset preferences when it generates the HTTP header. Details on how to control this will be discussed later in this course.</li>

                        <li>HTML was a language created at the dawn of the Web, using SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) as a template</li>
                        <li>Over the next decade, various additions, improvements and changes are introduced</li>
                        <li>HTML 4.01 released in December 1999</li>
                        <li>Initially used for documents and a place for the technically inclined, the web did not have the international pervasiveness it does today</li>

                    <p>As of October 28, 2014, HTML5 is the official W3C recommendation
                        HTML5 is more evolutionary then revolutionary. The bulk of previous HTML elements and attributes are maintained, with a few deprecations, and several additions.

                        <li>Ability to embed XML, MathML or SVG markup.</li>
                        <li>Standardized Javascript API increases client side script compatibility across browsers</li>
                        <li>Backwards compatible - older versions of HTML can effectively be updated by simply changing the doctype to HTML5</li>

                    <p>Pre-HTML5, there were basically two categories of tags: inline and block. HTML5 intoduces a more nuanced set of categories that allow for greater semantic sectioning of content. The content model will help the browser to determine the semantics of your content. </p>

                    <h2>Content Models</h2>
                    <p>The section tag can be used to semantically group content. It can remove ambiguity when a page is being processed by the browser, a screen reader, or search engine.
                        For example, imagine you have created the following code:
                        Since content that follows a heading is presumed to be associated with that heading, the code above carries plenty of semantic value already. But, if the small tag's content is intended to apply to all cities, a browser has no way of knowing that. It will instead assume the small tag is associated with the preceding heading 
                        Use the section tag to explicitly demarcate the start and end of the related content:
                        This new sectioning will inform the browser that the small is associated with the h1
                        In HTML5, each piece of sectioned content has its own self-contained outline. This means you wont need to worry as much about which level heading tag to use. You can use an h1 inside a section and it will be treated as the heading of the section, and have lesser semantic impact than an h1 that is at a higher level.

                    <h2>Scaleable Vector Graphics</h2>
                    <p>Scaleable Vector Graphics (SVG) can be embedded into HTML5 documents. SVG are 100% scalable without the pixelated effect that scaled raster images can suffer from. SVG file data is stored as text, so they are much smaller in file size than a raster equivalent.
                        </p>
                   <p>You can use SVG graphics with the <b>img</b> tag, just as with raster graphics. You can also use .svg as a CSS <b>background-image.</b></p>

                   <p>Alternatively, you can use SVG code 'inline' with the svg tag. The advantage of doing this is it will result in one less request/response between the client and the server. The disadvantage to inline SVG is that it adds considerable clutter to your your .html code. Just copy the source code from your .svg file and paste it directly into your .html!</p>
